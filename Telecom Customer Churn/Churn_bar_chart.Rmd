## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## import data and High level data information

Below code snippet to import the data from data source that is CSV file, Please download the data source csv file from provided location below and import this dataset.

```{r customer}
customer_churn_df <- read_csv("C:/Users/shant/Documents/R Programs/Telecom Customer Churn/telecom_customer_churn.csv")

customer_churn <- customer_churn_df%>% na.omit()  #omitted the blank values from Dataset

View(customer_churn)

glimpse(customer_churn) #High level structure of Dataset

```

## Including Plots

Below code snippet is to create the bar chart for churn category by considering the gender and offer selection

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
# Below code snippet to generate the graph plot with specific visual category
p1 <- ggplot(data = customer_churn) + 
                
      geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = ChurnCategory, fill = Gender), color = "Black") +
                        facet_wrap(~Offer) 
#Below code snippet to append the plot title along with X and Y axis label
p2 <- p1 + labs(title = "Churn Count according to Churn Category Offer wise", x = "Churn Category", y = "Total Churn Count")                        

# Below code line is to modify the axis text, title font color, style, text size etc.
Finalplot <- p2 + theme(strip.text.x = element_text(face = "bold", color = "DarkRed", size = 12),
                          axis.title = element_text(color = "Red", face = "bold", size = 15),
                          axis.text = element_text(color = "darkgreen", size = 12,  angle = 30),
                          legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
                          legend.text = element_text(face = "bold.italic", color = "brown4", size = 10),
                          title = element_text(size = 15))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
